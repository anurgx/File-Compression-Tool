# File Compression Tool (Huffman Coding) – C++

A **lossless file compression tool** implemented in **C++** using the **Huffman Coding algorithm**.  
The project demonstrates how character frequency and greedy algorithms can be used to reduce file size efficiently.

---

## ✨ Features
- Compresses a text file → `compressed.txt`
- Decompresses it back → `decompressed.txt`
- Uses **frequency table + Huffman Tree**
- Ensures **lossless compression**
- Beginner-friendly and interview-safe implementation

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Greedy Algorithm  
- Priority Queue  
- Binary Tree  
- File Handling  
- Hash Maps
